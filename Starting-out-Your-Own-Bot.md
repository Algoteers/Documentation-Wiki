## Step 1: A Bit of Planning

First thing to do is understanding what you wish to do and deciding which of the existing bots resembles the most to what your own bot should end up looking like.

Are you doing an indicator bot? A trading bot? What kind of process will your bot involve? What kind of data output should your bot have? Which of the existing bots is the most similar to your requirements?

## Step 2: Using an Existing Bot as a Starting Point

### Copy and Rename Bot

Once you have identified the bot that is the most similar to yours, clone the corresponding repository and --once in your local machine-- copy and paste the repository’s root folder, renaming it with the name of your new bot.

Make sure you follow the naming convention using the following string:

“**AA**”+”**BotName**”+”**-Indicator-Bot**” _or_ “**-Trading-Bot**”

e.g.: _AAOlivia-Indicator-Bot_

> NOTE: Make sure the bot name is unique. That is, no other bot by any other Dev Team can have the same name.

### Rename Solution

[*Optional: VS IDE only] Now rename the solution using the following syntax: “**AA**”+“**BotName**”+“**-TypeOfBot-**”+“**Bot**”+“**.sln**”

e.g.: _AAOlivia-Indicator-Bot.sln_

### Remove .git Folder

Next, delete the hidden _.git_ folder to eliminate the relation to the original GitHub repository.

### Add GitHub Repository

Now is a good time to go to GitHub and [add a new local repository](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) within your own organization. Name the repository after your bot (use the exact same name as the root folder). Make sure you include a concise description of what the bot does. Upload the files in your local repository to the GitHub repository so that GitHub takes control of the association between your local files and the ones at GitHub.

### Request a Storage Account

Bots store data in the cloud. For the time being, the process for opening a storage account for your bot is manual. Please send us a request including your bot's name to feedback@advancedalgos.org. When the request is processed, you will get a text file with a string similar to the following:

```
  "storage": {
    "sas": "?sv=2017-07-29&ss=f&srt=sco&sp=r&se=2018-12-30T23:44:52Z&st=2018-02-25T15:44:52Z&spr=https&sig=0pzOTcaRdfYgH7C4KmA1Rbs15kyjvVC1XFCsLQYjXKU%3D",
    "fileUri": "https://botname.file.core.windows.net"
  }
```

You will use this string in the next step...

### Configure Bot

* Open _this.bot.config.json_. This is the bit of the configuration file that concerns the AACloudPlatform:

```
"displayName": "ExampleBot",
  "codeName": "AAExampleBot",
  "type": "Trading",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "devTeam": "AAExampleOrg",
  "dataSetVersion": "dataSet.V1",
  "processes": [
    {
      "name": "Trading-Process",
      "description": "Simple trading strategy to be used as a template.",
      "startMode": {
        "allMonths": {
          "run": "false",
          "minYear": "",
          "maxYear": ""
        },
        "oneMonth": {
          "run": "false",
          "year": "",
          "month": ""
        },
        "noTime": {
          "run": "true"
        }
      },
      "executionWaitTime": 60000,
      "retryWaitTime": 10000
    }
```

You need to update that segment of the config with the following things in mind:

 - *displayName* (your bot's name without the AA prefix)
 - *codeName* (name with the AA prefix; e.g. AAMariam)
 - *type* (change if appropriate)
 - *version* (start with 1.0.0)
 - *devTeam* (your organization's name)
 - *dataSetVersion* (different versions of bots may use different versions of datasets"
 - The process name in case you decided to change it
 - Delete the config for any unused processes

Now scroll down to the bottom of the config and replace the string concerning to the storage account with the one you got from us on the previous title. Save the file when you are done.

[*Optional: VS IDE only] Next, open the recently renamed solution in your IDE and make the following changes:

* In the Solution Explorer window:
  - You may want to rename one of the existing processes (the one you are planning to use).
  - Delete the remaining original unused processes, if any.

### Configure the AACloudPlatform

We will first configure which bot to run. Open _AACloudPlatform.sln_. In the Solution Explorer window, scroll down and open _this.vm.config.json_. Enter your bot’s name and path in the config file as shown below:

[[https://github.com/AdvancedAlgos/Documentation/blob/master/Media/Dev-Teams-Getting-Sarted-Guide/Visual-Studio-01.png]]

Now we need to tell the platform which process to run. Click on the AACloudPlatform node and enter the process name as the value for the Script arguments field.

## Step 3: Start Coding

Now you are good to go. We’ve found the following workflow is quite practical:

* Code directly in the bot’s solution until the code is fully implemented.
* Close the bot’s module and go to the cloud platform solution to debug (as explained here). While debugging, the bot’s files will pop up in separate tabs, so that you can edit the code in the process.

> NOTE: Please, bear in mind that the data produced by other bots available in the testnet storage may be inconsistent, incomplete or even faulty. If you are using other bot's dataset as input for your own bots, it might be a good idea to isolate portions of the data and even move it to your local environment to work in isolation temporarily.

## Step 4: Configure Dev Team and Bots to Run in the Cloud

Now that your bots are ready and you are happy with the datasets they produce, it is time to register your Dev Team and bots in the AA Platform so that they can run in the cloud. Running in the cloud is not that different from running the bot locally.

### Configuration File

Clone the [[AAPlatform|https://github.com/AdvancedAlgos/AAPlatform]] repository and open _ecosystem.json_. You will need to locate the following piece of code:

```
    {
      "codeName": "AAMasters",
      "displayName": "AA Masters",
      "bots": [
        {
          "repo": "AAOlivia-Indicator-Bot",
          "configFile": "this.bot.config.json"
        },
        {
          "repo": "AATom-Indicator-Bot",
          "configFile": "this.bot.config.json"
        },
        {
          "repo": "AAMariam-Trading-Bot",
          "configFile": "this.bot.config.json"
        }
      ],
      "plotters": [
        {
          "description": "Plots traditional red and green candles.",
          "repo": "Plotters-Candles-Volumes",
          "moduleName": "Candles",
          "target": "Timeline"
        },
        {
          "description": "Plots volumes separated in buy and sell.",
          "repo": "Plotters-Candles-Volumes",
          "moduleName": "Volumes",
          "target": "Timeline"
        },
        {
          "description": "Plots Candle Stairs patterns.",
          "repo": "Plotters-Stairs-Patterns",
          "moduleName": "CandleStairs",
          "target": "Timeline"
        },
        {
          "description": "Plots Volume Stairs patterns.",
          "repo": "Plotters-Stairs-Patterns",
          "moduleName": "VolumeStairs",
          "target": "Timeline"
        },
        {
          "description": "Plots a trading history.",
          "repo": "Plotters-Trading",
          "moduleName": "History",
          "target": "Timeline"
        },
        {
          "description": "Plots trading decisions in an easy to understand way.",
          "repo": "Plotters-Trading",
          "moduleName": "Details",
          "target": "Timeline"
        }
      ]
    }
```

Copy the piece of code and replicate it immediately below the closing key. Modify the pasted code to incorporate the details of your own GitHub organization and your own bots.

> You will notice the configuration describes _plotters_. We haven't discussed those yet, so simply delete the related segments.

Once you are finished, commit the changes and submit a pull request. Someone in the AdvancedAlgos Organization will analyze your request and pull it into the main branch's code if everything looks right.
